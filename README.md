## Packages

* `client` - the frontend interface for the Sommelier stack. Made with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
* `deploy` - Scripts and tools for deployment on Sommelier infra (work in progress).
* `server` - a Node.js Express server handling data querying and caching for the front end. No database - it's a stateless integration later.
* `sommelier-types` - TypeScript types and other shared code between packages.
* `workers` - Supporting workers and services to analyze and alert on changing market conditions.

## Ecosystem Dependencies

* [Cosmos](https://cosmos.network/) - The Sommelier protocol is built on the Cosmos network - meaning faster tranasctions, lower fees, and a universe of interoperability.
* [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) - Sommelier began as a tool for LP positions on Uniswap. More AMM integrations are coming soon!
* [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) - Sommelier uses a custom implementation of the [Uniswap V2 Subgraph](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/uniswap/uniswap-v2) for indexing and query Uniswap event data.
* [Infura](https://infura.io/) - We use Infura as our Ethereum provider, with a roadmap for adding additional providers and redundancies on our backend.
* [web3js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.3.0/) - used for connecting to client wallets (e.g. Metamask) and transaction construction and signing.
