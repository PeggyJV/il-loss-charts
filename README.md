## Packages

-   `client` - the frontend interface for the Sommelier stack. Made with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
-   `deploy` - Scripts and tools for deployment on Sommelier infra (work in progress).
-   `server` - a Node.js Express server handling data querying and caching for the front end. No database - it's a stateless integration later.
-   `sommelier-types` - TypeScript types and other shared code between packages.
-   `workers` - Supporting workers and services to analyze and alert on changing market conditions.

## Ecosystem Dependencies

-   [Cosmos](https://cosmos.network/) - The Sommelier protocol is built on the Cosmos network - meaning faster transactions, lower fees, and a universe of interoperability.
-   [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) - Sommelier began as a tool for LP positions on Uniswap. More AMM integrations are coming soon!
-   [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) - Sommelier uses a custom implementation of the [Uniswap V2 Subgraph](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/uniswap/uniswap-v2) for indexing and query Uniswap event data.
-   [Infura](https://infura.io/) - We use Infura as our Ethereum provider, with a roadmap for adding additional providers and redundancies on our backend.
-   [web3js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.3.0/) - used for connecting to client wallets (e.g. Metamask) and transaction construction and signing.

## Setup

Sommelier has a standard monorepo setup using [Yarn Workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/blog/2017/08/02/introducing-workspaces/) and [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna). This allows one to run commands at the project root and apply that command to all packages.

To set up the app for local development:

```
git clone https://github.com/PeggyJV/il-loss-charts
cd il-loss-charts

yarn config set workspaces-experimental true # Use to enable yarn workspaces
yarn # Running 'yarn' once at workspace roots installs all dependencies for each package

### Local Development

yarn dev # starts both express server and CRA webpack server in same shell, with re-compile on save for both server and client

### Building and Running

yarn build # builds each package
yarn prod # runs the server only, which serves the client bundle

### Linting

yarn lint # lints each package serially
```

Lerna infers package topology to ensure that all lint/build tasks run in the proper order based on inter-package dependencies.

## API Documentation

The `server` package uses [OpenAPI](https://github.com/PeggyJV/il-loss-charts) for documentation. You can see compiled documentation at [https://app.sommelier.finance/api/explorer/](https://app.sommelier.finance/api/explorer/) or [http://localhost:3001/api/explorer](http://localhost:3001/api/explorer) (when running locally).

The documentation source is at `packages/server/src/docs/api.yml`. When adding a new API route, make sure to update this file. The server uses [Express OpenAPI Validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-openapi-validator) so if your route is not correctly documented, it will not be validated correctly and will not work as expected.
