## Todos

### UI

-   Apply look and feel (designer?)
-   Optimize loading times, transitions, i.e. make it snappy
-   Add logos for coins in selected pair (more visually interesting)

### Data

-   Check misalignment of y-axis on some pairs where return goes negative (e.g. YFI/WETH)
-   Add switch for 24h and 7d for stats on top bar
-   Calculate additional USD return for zero-stablecoin pairs (e.g. YFI/WETH)
-   Fix intraday data issue - except for top bar, graph data is only up to beginning of current day
-   Long term - swap out Uniswap graph for chain data?

### Code

-   Clean up dependencies I didn't end up using
-   Get bundle size down
-   Write tests
